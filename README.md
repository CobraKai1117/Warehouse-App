**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The goal of the project was to develop an app that would allow users to perform CRUD operations on products in a warehouse setting through a mobile inventory app. These products are stored through a database. Using the UI, users could add new products to the database. These would be updated in the view the user would see. Users could also update how many of the products were on hand as well as delete them from the database.
